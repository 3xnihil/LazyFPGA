### FPGA Install Helper             ###
### for Quartus Prime Lite (23.1.1) ###
#######################################
#
# Author: Johannes HÃ¼ffer
# Date: 15.11.2024
# Version: 0.1
#
# Automated postinstall-setup for RHEL- and Debian-based
# Linux distros installing Intel FPGA components aiming post-installation
# support after the original installer did its incomplete job.
# Why? Because Intel for any reason (unlike on Windows) doesn't
# deliver a complete install on Linux systems and leaves its users
# with a kind of half-baked setup.
#
# ==> This skript aims to fix the hassels coming with this incomplete setup.
#
# After the regular install handeled by Intel, it ...
#
#   I)      Downloads the Quartus-installer (v. 23.1.1) directly from Intel;
#   II)     Launches the installer after the download has finished;
#   III)    Moves the Intel installation to the systems '/opt' directory;
#   IV)     Changes the necessary environment variables pointing to
#           this new directory;
#   V)      Creates desktop entries for Quartus and Questa such that
#           they could be launched from the desktop's menus easily;
#   VI)     Downloads nice icons for both Quartus and Questa from Github(*);
#   VII)    Creates new MIME-types for Quartus' and Questa's project files
#           allowing these file types to be opened directly in file managers;
#   VIII)   Creates the necessary udev-rules for Intel "USB-blaster" support;
#   IX)     Gives a short hint and summary to the end. :)
